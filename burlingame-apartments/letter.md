Mrs. Kane,
I'm writing in regards to the Burlingame Planning Commission meeting on November
13th, regarding item 9d, the property at 920 Bayswater Avenue. I am a renter
and a resident of Belmont and I would be eligible to live in the proposed
development, if it were constructed. I have an interest in building enough
housing to keep up with San Mateo County's growing population.

Chair Peter Gum expressed concern about school overcrowding,
according to this article in the San Mateo Daily Journal:
http://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/burlingame-apartments-review-tepid/arti
cle_aade7b2a-c9c8-11e7-b528-fba1582870c9.html

Specifically the language in the article is:

> We need to look at this type of thing,” said Gum, citing traffic congestion,
> limited parking and school overcrowding among his primary concerns generated by
> the proposal.

It is my understanding that it is illegal to make a land use decision
in California on the basis that schools are inadequate. See here:
http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-65996.html, specifically:

> a state or local agency may not deny or refuse to approve a legislative or
> adjudicative act, or both, involving, but not limited to, the planning, use,
> or development of real property or any change in governmental organization or
> reorganization, as defined in Section 56021 or 56073, on the basis that school
> facilities are inadequate.

This was also cited recently in a staff report by the Town of Danville (in the East Bay) as follows:

> "A number of speakers expressed concern that the project would create
> overcrowding at the local schools. There is no evidence to support this concern.
> According to the most recent enrollment projections for the San Ramon Valley
> Unified School District (March 2016), there is adequate room at the affected
> schools to accommodate the number of students that would be generated by the
> project.

> "However, even if there were a projected lack of classroom space, state
> law prohibits the Town from taking that into consideration in reviewing the
> application. Legislation dating back to 1998 provides that the exclusive
> mitigation for school impacts of development are the impact fees that are
> charged by the local school district. Cities and counties are prohibited from
> taking any further actions. Government Code Section 65996."

By mentioning up school overcrowding, and especially in his role as the Planning
Commission Chair, Mr. Gum improperly influenced the discussion around the
project. I would like an apology and an acknowledgement that this issue won't be
raised again in discussions over the project.

In particular, this law was passed in the 1990's because we were not building
enough housing to keep up with California's growing population, and people kept
citing the lack of schools as a reason to block more housing. San Mateo County
is in desperate need of more housing; rents have doubled since 2010. Mr. Gum's
comments seem to be exactly the type of comments and politicking the law is
designed to prevent.

Best,
Kevin
