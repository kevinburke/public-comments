I'm a renter and small business owner in Belmont. San Mateo County renters have
seen rents double since 2010; the average rent in Burlingame has gone from $1300
to $2800. There's no rent control in San Mateo County and renters don't have any
protections against higher prices that homeowners do, like 30 year mortgages or
Prop 13. I know several folks here in Belmont who have seen their rent double in
the last four years. Statewide, a third of renters are paying half their salary
in rent.

Over the same time frame (2010-2017) San Mateo County has added 75,000 jobs
and only 4,000 housing units. This has increased competition for apartments in
Burlingame and driven up rents. It also increases traffic because commuters have
to drive long distances to get to their jobs. The solution to both of these
problems is to build enough new housing in San Mateo County to keep up with job
growth. Last year for example San Francisco built a record amount of housing -
5000 units - and saw rents and owner move-in evictions both drop.

It hurts to hear Chair Gum wonder whether the project is "right for
Burlingame" right now. That argument really only makes sense if you are
secure in your home. Many renters are not secure in their homes. We need to
build more housing to keep rents from rising even further and displacing
even more Burlingame residents. The California Legislative Analyst's
Office agrees: we need more private housing in coastal urban areas.

I would much rather have a traffic crisis, or a neighborhood character crisis,
than a housing crisis. It's easy to quantify the harm that high housing prices
done to people who are paying half their salary in rent, or riding the VTA all
night because they can't make ends meet. It's harder to say with a straight
face that having to share the roads or schools with a slightly larger number of
people compares in any way.

Please vote to approve the project, if anything let's try to put as many units
in it as possible. We need them.
