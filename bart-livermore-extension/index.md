I can't attend the meeting Thursday night, please consider this my comment on
the Livermore extension:

I live in Belmont and frequently ride BART from Millbrae to commute and to
travel all around the Bay Area.

I think the Livermore proposal as currently implemented would be a bad idea for
BART. The cost per projected rider is very, very high. I think this money would
be better spent on BART's core operations.

One big problem with the Livermore extension is it does not terminate in a dense
area. This means people have to drive to the station and is the opposite of
environmentally friendly, transit oriented development. BART should reconsider
options that would terminate the line in downtown Livermore. Alternatively BART
should focus on buying and building 5-story apartments in the station area,
and/or condition station approval on Livermore zoning for multifamily housing in
a half mile radius around the station.

If that's not feasible then I think the money would be better spent in BART's
core operations, or on buying land near BART stations and building more housing
on it.

People have put a lot of trust in BART with the ballot measure and the BART
board needs to uphold that trust by spending the money responsibly. Extending
BART to a station only reachable by car, with very low projected ridership, is
not a responsible use of the public trust.
