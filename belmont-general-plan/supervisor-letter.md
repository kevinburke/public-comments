I'm a renter in Belmont. I was wondering if you would be interested in
giving a comment on Belmont's draft environmental impact report for
their upcoming changes to the General Plan, described in detail here:
http://www.belmont-2035generalplan.com/library.html

Broadly, the proposed EIR lays out two alternatives for Belmont's development
over the next ~20 years.

**Proposal**<br>
1500 new housing units<br>
~175 affordable units<br>
3300 jobs

**Alternative 1**<br>
2400 new housing units<br>
~300 affordable units<br>
2100 jobs

Of interest to you as a supervisor, from the perspective of the EIR, the people
that *could have* lived in Belmont, had it built more housing, basically
disappear from the analysis of the Proposal. Of course, those people don't
actually disappear: They live in other San Mateo County towns, or &mdash; worse
&mdash; live somewhere cheaper like Livermore or Gilroy and clutter up San Mateo
Bridge/Highway 101 commuting to their job in Belmont. That's not great for
traffic and it's not great for the environment.

I would also like to note that since 2010, San Mateo County has added 75,000
jobs and only 4,000 new housing units. In that environment, it's not surprising
that average rents in San Mateo County have risen from $1600 per month to $3100
per month. That puts a huge strain on families and renters like myself.

**Can you submit a comment on Belmont's draft EIR?** In particular I think it
would be good for renters, and for the region as a whole, for Belmont to build
more housing and less office space (Alternative 1) or the same amount of office
space and an equal amount of housing. Belmont is also considering annexing
the Harbor Industrial Area; I would encourage you to make that annexation
conditional on rezoning all or a portion of the HIA for multi-family housing.

The comment period ends in a few weeks. The contact email address for public
comments is Carlos de Melo, the city Community Development Director. His email
address is cdemelo@belmont.gov.

Thanks!
Kevin
