# Counterpoint: Building more is the solution for housing shortage

I have to disagree with the op ed published yesterday, "Building more is not the
solution for housing shortage." The op ed defends Assemblymember Marc Levine's
attempts to duck Marin's requirements to build housing under the Regional
Housing Needs Assessment, and seeks to blame San Francisco for not building
enough new housing.

It's true that San Francisco has added more new office space than housing, and
it's true that San Francisco should build more housing. The Central SOMA plan in
particular is currently projected to add 40,000 jobs worth of new office space
downtown, and only 6,000 new housing units. That's unacceptable, and you should
express your frustration with this plan to San Francisco's Planning Commission
and Board of Supervisors.

But generally, we don't allow people to excuse bad behavior by pointing to other
bad behavior. And in fact, San Francisco has been better about building new
housing than Marin has, by any measure. Since 1990, California's population has
increased by 32%. San Francisco has increased its population by 20% and its
housing stock by 20%; Marin has increased its population by 14% and its total
housing stock by only 12%.

San Francisco has also taken more positive steps to increase its housing
supply: electing more pro-housing legislators, building 5000 units in 2016,
and approving HOME SF which will increase the amount of housing throughout
the city. Marin has gone in the opposite direction: countywide, only 700 new
housing units have been built since 2010 (versus 14,000 new jobs). And Marin's
state representatives have been asking for California to exempt Marin from
requirements to zone for housing.

Conditions have also gotten a lot tougher for the 38% of Marin County's
population that rents. Homeowners are protected from large price increases via
long-term mortgages and Prop 13; no such protections exist for Marin's renters.
A one bedroom apartment in San Rafael averaged $1536 per month in 2011, and now
averages $2480, a 61% increase. This increase in prices has pushed more renters
to Marin's streets: the number of chronic homeless in Marin has risen, and
studies consistently show that a majority of homeless people were previously
living in apartments in the area before going to the street.

Homes are further and further out of reach for Marin renters and Marin youth.
The median home in Marin sold for $350,000 in 1990 - seven times Marin's
median household income - and today sells for $1.06 million, or *eleven times*
Marin's median household income. So for the average renter trying to save to
buy a home, or just get by - your post-college children, their friends, your
young employees, your city's teachers, police officers, and firefighters - get
squeezed twice: they pay way more each month to their landlord, and Marin homes
cost almost 50% more than they used to. No one is entitled to a home, but the
bar for homeownership has become about twice as high as it used to be.

The author is correct that we have seen an increase in the number of people
treating homes as investment vehicles. But that's an argument for changing the
incentives facing homeowners, not for denying new housing construction. The
logic is circular: A housing shortage increases home values, which encourages
speculation... so we shouldn't build any more housing.

California homeowners have a strong incentive, and many opportunities (via CEQA,
City Hall, and the ballot box) to boost their own home values by denying the
construction of new housing near them. I have been to dozens of City Council and
Board of Supervisors meetings throughout the Bay Area, and it's always the same
story: older homeowners opposing new housing, and younger renters and homeowners
supporting it. SB 35 proposes to fix this incentive structure by reducing the
number of opportunities for homeowners and activist City Council members to
block housing developments that comply with a city's existing zoning code.
Marin's cities can still decide their future growth path by providing clear
guidelines in the zoning code. But once they set those rules, SB 35 asks cities
to play by them.

The author acknowledges that wages for Americans have been stagnant, but fails
to discuss why they have stagnated. Historically Americans have bettered
their situation by packing up and moving to cities with great job markets and
higher wages. In turn, those areas have built enough new housing to keep up
with job growth. But lately, areas with hot job markets like the Bay Area and
New York have not built enough housing to keep up with demand. The result is
lower-skilled workers in the Bay Area earn higher wages, but end up paying 100%
of that increase to their landlord. This is discussed in further detail by Peter
Ganong and Daniel Shoag in their paper, "Why has Regional Income Convergence
in the U.S. Declined?" Reducing the amount of new housing construction, as
Assemblymember Levine wants to do, will worsen this problem, and increase income
inequality in California.

As good as the last few years have been for property values for Marin's
homeowners, they've been brutal for Marin's renters and young people. No one
can force Marin to build more housing, building more housing would help reduce
the current frenzy of competition for apartments, and keep prices from rising
even further. Building more housing would help your kids, your kids' teachers,
and your city employees to put down roots in Marin. Lower rents would help keep
Marin's poor afford to stay in their apartments, instead of increasing the ranks
of the homeless.

Rather than try to win a finger pointing contest, Marin's cities could
distinguish themselves with an agenda that commits to reducing income
inequality, reducing homelessness, and reducing median rents. All three of these
have the same solution: Find ways to build more housing, at the local and state
levels.
