I'm a renter who grew up in Alamo, and I still live in the Bay Area. My parents live in Alamo, I'm saving up to buy a home and I would like to move back there.

California has gotten really expensive for renters. Statewide, a third of renters pay half their salary in rent. That's not good for quality of life. It certainly doesn't help people who are saving up for a home, as I am.

The main reason that housing is so expensive is we're not building enough new housing to keep up with population growth. This means there's more competition for existing homes and apartments, and more competition means the price goes up. The state Legislative Analyst's Office agrees: http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.aspx

Alameda County has added 55,400 jobs since 2010 and only 15000 housing units. Contra Costa County has added 63,900 jobs since 2010 and only 9,520 housing units. All of those workers need a place to live.

I read that you have an opportunity tomorrow night to vote to bring more housing to Livermore. I hope you ask the developer to build the maximum feasible amount of housing, and refrain from asking for further reductions in the number of units. Given a percentage of units will be offered at BMR rates, the larger the number of units, the more families that will get rent relief and protection from displacement. You have the power to give that chance to families tomorrow night.

I would also urge you to consider lowering the parking minimums attached to the project. Seattle recently found that 40-48% of its renters don't use cars to get around: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/residents-fight-seattle-rules-allowing-apartment-developers-to-forgo-parking/. That number is sure to grow as our generation gets older. I don't have a car and I don't plan to; I use the bus and the train and if I need a car I rent one on Getaround or take a taxi. It works out to be a lot cheaper than owning a car and paying the insurance. Especially if you could pair lower parking minimums with a BART route that heads through the downtown area, I think you would be in good shape.

Best,
Kevin
